I am currently a second-year Master's student at KAIST, having previously completed my Bachelor's degree at Yonsei University. My primary interest lies in the development of Neural Processing Units (NPUs) and their accompanying software stacks.
Currently, I am focused on designing NPU architectures capable of efficiently running edge-based Large Language Models (LLMs). I am also highly interested in ASIC design for the VR/AR ecosystem. My research experience spans various fields, including GPU/NPU kernel programming, FPGA-based open-source hardware development, and ASIC tape-out. I am passionate about creating functional, open-source hardware projects. Please feel free to contact me!!
